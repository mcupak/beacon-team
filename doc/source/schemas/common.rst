There are no directly associated methods.

.. avro:enum:: Strand

  :symbols: NEG_STRAND|POS_STRAND
  Indicates the DNA strand associate for some data item.
  * `NEG_STRAND`: The negative (-) strand.
  * `POS_STRAND`:  The postive (+) strand.

.. avro:record:: Position

  :field referenceName:
    The name of the `Reference` on which the `Position` is located.
  :type referenceName: string
  :field position:
    The 0-based offset from the start of the forward strand for that `Reference`.
      Genomic positions are non-negative integers less than `Reference` length.
  :type position: long
  :field strand:
    Strand the position is associated with.
  :type strand: Strand

  A `Position` is an unoriented base in some `Reference`. A `Position` is
  represented by a `Reference` name, and a base number on that `Reference`
  (0-based).

.. avro:record:: ExternalIdentifier

  :field database:
    The source of the identifier.
      (e.g. `Ensembl`)
  :type database: string
  :field identifier:
    The ID defined by the external database.
      (e.g. `ENST00000000000`)
  :type identifier: string
  :field version:
    The version of the object or the database
      (e.g. `78`)
  :type version: string

  Identifier from a public database

.. avro:enum:: CigarOperation

  :symbols: ALIGNMENT_MATCH|INSERT|DELETE|SKIP|CLIP_SOFT|CLIP_HARD|PAD|SEQUENCE_MATCH|SEQUENCE_MISMATCH
  An enum for the different types of CIGAR alignment operations that exist.
  Used wherever CIGAR alignments are used. The different enumerated values
  have the following usage:
  
  * `ALIGNMENT_MATCH`: An alignment match indicates that a sequence can be
    aligned to the reference without evidence of an INDEL. Unlike the
    `SEQUENCE_MATCH` and `SEQUENCE_MISMATCH` operators, the `ALIGNMENT_MATCH`
    operator does not indicate whether the reference and read sequences are an
    exact match. This operator is equivalent to SAM's `M`.
  * `INSERT`: The insert operator indicates that the read contains evidence of
    bases being inserted into the reference. This operator is equivalent to
    SAM's `I`.
  * `DELETE`: The delete operator indicates that the read contains evidence of
    bases being deleted from the reference. This operator is equivalent to
    SAM's `D`.
  * `SKIP`: The skip operator indicates that this read skips a long segment of
    the reference, but the bases have not been deleted. This operator is
    commonly used when working with RNA-seq data, where reads may skip long
    segments of the reference between exons. This operator is equivalent to
    SAM's 'N'.
  * `CLIP_SOFT`: The soft clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end
    of a read have not been considered during alignment. This may occur if the
    majority of a read maps, except for low quality bases at the start/end of
    a read. This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'S'. Bases that are soft clipped
    will still be stored in the read.
  * `CLIP_HARD`: The hard clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end of
    a read have been omitted from this alignment. This may occur if this linear
    alignment is part of a chimeric alignment, or if the read has been trimmed
    (e.g., during error correction, or to trim poly-A tails for RNA-seq). This
    operator is equivalent to SAM's 'H'.
  * `PAD`: The pad operator indicates that there is padding in an alignment.
    This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'P'.
  * `SEQUENCE_MATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the aligned
    sequence exactly matches the reference (e.g., all bases are equal to the
    reference bases). This operator is equivalent to SAM's '='.
  * `SEQUENCE_MISMATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the
    aligned sequence is an alignment match to the reference, but a sequence
    mismatch (e.g., the bases are not equal to the reference). This can
    indicate a SNP or a read error. This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'X'.

.. avro:record:: CigarUnit

  :field operation:
    The operation type.
  :type operation: CigarOperation
  :field operationLength:
    The number of bases that the operation runs for.
  :type operationLength: long
  :field referenceSequence:
    `referenceSequence` is only used at mismatches (`SEQUENCE_MISMATCH`)
      and deletions (`DELETE`). Filling this field replaces the MD tag.
      If the relevant information is not available, leave this field as `null`.
  :type referenceSequence: null|string

  A structure for an instance of a CIGAR operation.
  `FIXME: This belongs under Reads (only readAlignment refers to this)`
